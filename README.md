# User stories
  A. Initial user story was envisioned to include social integrations and more importantly photo capture from mobile device for post creation. Given that the app is based on drinks, it's more likely that target audiences will make use of this while out rather than at home.  I defaulted to hosted URL upload which is less desirable but meets project requirements.

  B. Limited authorization functionality hindered another key feature intended to allow users to manage their own posts and have right to modify while other users do not have the ability to modify. Based on limited authorization function, the UX was changed to reduce the prominence of those tools to prohibit users from taking action (outside of commenting) on posts that are not their own.

  C. User story ultimately updated to target the user who is more at-home, perhaps making cocktails for friends, but also keeping the UX open to allow users who are able to upload from bars/restaurants/etc. to provide more useful information in regard to location, drink quality and price.
